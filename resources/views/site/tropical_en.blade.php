    Businesses that grow by development and improvement do not die.<br>
    But when a business ceases to be creative, when it believes it has reached perfection and needs to do nothing but produce no improvement, no development, it is done" - Henry Ford

    These famous words by Mr Ford characterise companies that become very successful. At Neocodis we strive to be creative and innovative by taking on new challenges. For that reason we would like to tell you about one of the most interesting challenges we were put to at the end of last year. A representative of Tropical visited us at our office. Anyone who has had to do with fishkeeping and terraristic doesn’t need an introduction to this brand. For those who haven’t heard about Tropical, let me provide a short explanation
</p>

    Tropical was established in 1977. Thanks to systematic growth and constant focus on innovation and highest quality, the company became a leading brand on the polish and global market. It continues to grow its product range and business branches, offering over 700 products for domestic pets. What captivates us the most, is the attention Tropical pays to natural environment protection and ecology. These are not just declarations, but real investments. While extending their facilities in 2009, they built a huge biofilter, equipped with biological deposit, which ensures odor-free production, absorbing all elements, which could be troublesome for the community and the environment  (<a href="http://www.tropical.pl/en/about-us/" target="_blank" class="link1 anim">read more</a>). These were main reasons for our enthusiastic approach to this collaboration, because at Neocodis our mission is to support sustainable companies. Apart from that, our companies are almost neighbours location-wise.

<p class="desc">
    Tropical commenced our collaboration by donating a substantial amount of their animal food products to a charity initiative that Neocodis co-organised - <a href="http://www.santacloud.pl" target="_blank" class="link1 anim">www.santacloud.pl</a>

    As a next step, we designed and developed a brand new website for Tropical’ BIFLORIN product range - <a href="http://www.wyjatkowyogrod.pl" target="_blank" class="link1 anim">www.wyjatkowyogrod.pl</a>, which includes a full blown Content Management System. The website accompanied by a promotional video that we created, helped to present their products at <a href="http://gardenia.mtp.pl/en/" target="_blank" class="link1 anim">Gardenia</a>. It all started with orchids, geraniums and conifers...

    However, the next challenge was slightly more complex. Our task was to design and develop a website about humans’ best friend. This is how <a href="http://www.zdrowy-pies.pl" target="_blank" class="link1 anim">www.zdrowy-pies.pl</a> came to live, where dog lovers can learn not only about new food products, but also read about useful tips and sign up to the TropiDog club. This website gives a possibility to sign up to a newsletter and it is equipped with a Content Management System.

    Our collaboration is excellent, therefore we received another task. This time Tropical was going to announce their totally new, exclusive line of products - SOFT LINE - at the biggest fishkeeping fair in Nurnberg, Germany (<a href="https://www.interzoo.com/en" target="_blank" class="link1 anim">www.interzoo.com</a>). This new, innovative product has a soft structure and it is rich with nutrients. It is intended for exotic fish from around the world. SOFT LINE had to be presented in a spectacular way, this is why <a href="http://www.tropical-soft.pl" target="_blank" class="link1 anim">www.tropical-soft.pl</a> came to live.

    In the meantime we delivered a few updates made to Tropical’s official website - <a href="http://www.tropical.pl/en/" target="_blank" class="link1 anim">www.tropical.pl</a>. This initiated the planning of a new, revamped Tropical.pl platform. This challenge, as well as launching of a new, fourth website for Tropical (a contest website) will keep us focused in the upcoming months.

    You are probably wondering why are we sharing this article? We wanted to tell you about our philosophy and prove that polish companies can work together hand in hand on the international market by sharing  mutual values, such as believing in constant innovation and taking real action to protect natural environment, delivering high quality products, which compete and oftentimes win with international brands.
